				<p>
					This Data Protection Notice (“Notice”) sets out the basis which 360 Accounting (“we”, “us”, or “our”) may collect, use, disclose or otherwise process personal data of our customers in accordance with the Personal Data Protection Act (“PDPA”). This Notice applies to personal data in our possession or under our control, including personal data in the possession of organisations which we have engaged to collect, use, disclose or process personal data for our purposes.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h2>Personal Data</h2>
				<p>
					As used in this Notice: “personal data” means data, whether true or not, about a customer who can be identified: (a) from that data; or (b) from that data and other information to which we have or are likely to have access.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					The purpose of this policy is to inform you and provide you with an understanding of how we handle, collect, use, disclose and process your personal data. Changes to this Privacy Policy may be made periodically and you may wish to check this page from time to time.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					Depending on the nature of your interaction with us, some examples of personal data which we may collect from you include your name and identification information such as your NRIC/Passport number, contact information such as your address, email address or telephone number, nationality, gender, date of birth, marital status, employment information and financial information such as credit card numbers, debit card numbers or bank account information.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h2>Collection, Use and Disclosure of Personal Data</h2>
				<p>
					By providing us your personal data, you acknowledge and agree that you consent to the collection, use, processing and disclosure of your personal data as described in this policy.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					We may collect and use your personal data for any or all of the following purposes:
				</p>
				<ol class="lower-alpha-ol">
					<li>performing obligations in the course of or in connection with our provision of services requested by you;</li>
					<li>verifying your identity;</li>
					<li>responding to, handling, and processing queries, requests, applications, complaints, and feedback from you;</li>
					<li>managing your relationship with us;</li>
					<li>processing payment or credit transactions;</li>
					<li>sending you marketing information about our services;</li>
					<li>complying with any applicable laws, regulations, codes of practice, guidelines, or rules, or to assist in law enforcement and investigations conducted by any governmental and/or regulatory authority;</li>
					<li>any other purposes for which you have provided the information;</li>
					<li>transmitting to any unaffiliated third parties including our third party service providers and agents, and relevant governmental and/or regulatory authorities, whether in Singapore or abroad, for the aforementioned purposes; and</li>
					<li>any other incidental business purposes related to or in connection with the above.</li>
				</ol>
				<br>
				<p>
					We may disclose your personal data:
				</p>
				<ol class="lower-roman-ol">
					<li>where such disclosure is required for performing obligations in the course of or in connection with our provision of the services requested by you; or</li>
					<li>to third party service providers, agents and other organisations we have engaged to perform any of the functions listed above for us.</li>
				</ol>
				<br>
				<p>
					The purposes listed in the above clauses may continue to apply even in situations where your relationship with us (for example, pursuant to a contract) has been terminated or altered in any way, for a reasonable period thereafter (including, where applicable, a period to enable us to enforce our rights under any contract with you).
				</p>
				<br>
				<h2>Protection of Personal Data</h2>
				<p>
					To safeguard your personal data from unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks, we have introduced appropriate administrative, physical and technical measures.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h2>Retention of Personal Data</h2>
				<p>
					We may retain your personal data for as long as it is necessary to fulfil the purpose for which it was collected, or as required or permitted by applicable laws.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					We will cease to retain your personal data, or remove the means by which the data can be associated with you, as soon as it is reasonable to assume that such retention no longer serves the purpose for which the personal data was collected, and is no longer necessary for legal or business purposes.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h2>Data Protection Officer</h2>
				<p>
					You may contact our Data Protection Officer if you have any enquiries on our personal data protection policies and procedures. Please refer to ‘Contact’ for details.
